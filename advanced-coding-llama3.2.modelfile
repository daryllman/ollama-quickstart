FROM llama3.2

# Advanced parameters for better coding performance
PARAMETER temperature 0.3    # Controls randomness: lower = more focused, higher = more creative
PARAMETER top_p 0.85         # Nucleus sampling: controls diversity of token selection
PARAMETER top_k 40           # Limits token choices to top K most likely options
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.1 # Reduces repetitive text generation
PARAMETER num_ctx 65536      # Maximum context window size in tokens (64K - good balance for coding)
# Note: Llama 3.2 supports up to 131,072 tokens (128K) - this uses ~50% of max capacity
PARAMETER num_predict 2048   # Maximum number of tokens to generate in response
